## Database
#####################################

Notes: 

This database folder contains some transformed versions of the original retrieved data using the EventRegistry API, and the data are convenient to be used in any data analysis. 

The 'data_I_use' folder contains the final transformed version of the retrieved data which I am using in my main .ipynb file. The format of the data is mainly EXCEL format. 

The 'same_data_adapted_to_more_forms' folder contains some of the formats of the same data after splitting the train-validation-test sets. There are different constructions for these data inside this folder, aiming to be fed into some of the pre-trained models directly (the BERT-for-Task pre-trained model).
