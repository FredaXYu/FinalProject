year 's breakthrough prize fundamental physic honor pioneer quantum information science billion dollar pour quantum compute country build communication network secure quantum encryption prominence quantum information science become increasingly hard ignore year 's breakthrough prize fundamental physic honor four pioneer combine math computer science physic foundational work field quantum information prize share charles bennett ibm gilles brassard university montreal david deutsch university oxford peter shor massachusetts institute technology four people really contribute heavily emergence quantum information theory say nicolas gisin experimental quantum physicist university geneva nice see prize come closer heart breakthrough prize cofounded israelirussian billionaire physicist yuri milner 2012 lavishly support mogul include cofounder mark zuckerberg sergey brin similar alfred nobel whose nobel prizefunding fortune arise invention dynamite milner 's past financial tie kremlin draw scrutiny especially light russia 's ongoing invasion ukraine previous interview milner emphasize independence donation ukrainian refugee spokesperson point scientific american milner relocate u.s. 2014 return russia since recognition quantum information science always come easily financial support broadly speak field combination two theory quantum mechanic describe counterintuitive behavior atomic subatomic world information theory detail mathematical physical limit computation communication history messier story sporadic advance often overlook conventional scientific journal 1968 stephen wiesner graduate student columbia university develop new way encode information polarize photon among thing wiesner propose inherently fragile nature quantum state could use create counterfeitresistant quantum money unable publish many heady theoretical idea draw religion wiesner die last year largely quit academia become construction worker israel wiesner leave columbia pass along idea another young researcher one roommate boyfriend stephen wiesner start tell 'quantum money bennett recall strike interest seem like begin whole new field late 1970s bennett meet brassard two begin discuss wiesner 's money imagine might require improbable task trap photon mirror create quantum banknote photon mean stay mean travel brassard say explain think process travel natural communicate protocol bennett brassard propose call bb84 would launch field quantum cryptography later detail popularize scientific american bb84 allow two party exchange message utmost secrecy third party snoop would leave indelible evidence interference like damage quantum wax seal bennett brassard develop quantum cryptography another radical idea begin emerge quantum compute famous meet m.i.t endicott house dedham mass. may 1981 physicist richard feynman propose computer use quantum principle could solve problem impossible computer bind law classical physic although attend conference deutsch hear idea hook gradually get convince link computation physic say chat bennett later year deutsch experience crucial epiphany prevail computational theory base wrong physic classical mechanic isaac newton relativistic approach albert einstein rather deeper quantum reality think would rewrite theory computation base quantum theory instead base classical theory deutsch say matteroffactly expect anything fundamentally new come expect rigorous soon however realize describe vastly different kind computer even achieve result get principle quantum mechanic deutsch 's new theory provide crucial link quantum mechanic information theory make quantum mechanic accessible language computer science say umesh vazirani computer scientist university california berkeley later australian mathematician richard josza deutsch propose proof principle first algorithm would exponentially faster classical algorithm although anything practical soon useful application emerge 1991 artur ekert graduate student oxford propose new quantum cryptography protocol e91 technique catch attention many physicist elegance practicality well fact publish lead physic journal beautiful idea bite surprise ekert part list winner year 's fundamental physic breakthrough prize gisin say two year later bennett brassard josza computer science researcher claude cr¨¦peau physicist asher peres william wootters propose quantum teleportation physicist pay attention new technique would give one party ability transmit information result coin flip another via entanglement quantum correlation link object electron despite popular sciencefiction assertion technique allow fasterthanlight message dramatically expand possibility realworld quantum communication mindboggling idea say chaoyang lu quantum physicist university science technology china help implement technique space word revolution overuse describe progress science usually plod incremental 1994 shor quietly begin one work att bell laboratory absorb talk vazirani bennett start think useful thing could quantum computer say think long shoot interest area start work really tell anybody inspire success quantum algorithm task periodic repeat shor develop algorithm could divide number prime factor example 21 7 x 3 exponentially quicker classical algorithm implication immediately obvious prime factorization backbone modern encryption last quantum computer truly gamechanging practical application shor 's algorithm make absolutely clear drop everything work quantum compute vazirani say although shor find powerful use case quantum computer solve harder problem build one even theory fragile quantum state device could exploit surpass classical compute also make extremely vulnerable error moreover error correction strategy classical computer could use quantum computer undeterred quantum compute conference turin italy 1995 shor bet researcher quantum computer would factor 500digit number classical computer even today 's classical supercomputer factor 500 digit would likely take billion year one take shor 's bet ask third option sun would burn first two type error plague quantum computer bite error phase error error akin flip compass needle north south east west respectively unfortunately correct bite error make phase error worse vice versa word precise bear north result le accurate bear east west later 1995 shor figure combine bite correction phase correction chain operation unlike solve rubik 's cube without alter complete side shor 's algorithm remain ineffective quantum computer become powerful highest number factor algorithm 21 classical factor remain lead still make quantum compute possible practical whole thing become real brassard say work lead new view quantum mechanic compute deutsch inspire even fundamental theory constructor say describe set physical transformation others remain agnostic likelihood deep insight emerge quantum realm quantum mechanic really strange think ever go easy way understand shor say ask whether work quantum compute make nature reality easier harder understand impishly say certainly make mysterious begin pastime eclectic intellectual pursuit grow far beyond many wildest imagine field 's pioneer never think would ever become practical lot fun think crazy idea brassard say point decide serious people follow u frustrate recognize extent extremely \<SEP>4
