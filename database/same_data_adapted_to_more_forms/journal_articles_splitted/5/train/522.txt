zodrow mieszkowski 1986 keen marchand 1997 analyze public good public input separately different public expenditure however keen marchand 1997 state may quite difficult definitively differentiate local public good local public input local public expenditure example case education harbor road clean air specifically instance road necessary facilitate production local public input enable resident
