13:09 ask question want learn people really want like little bite supportive early career like say like look early career patriotic like idealize like oh gosh even talk right like idealize idea like oh early career nice guy everything like flexibility everything nice stage go terrible like okay tell little bite like positive thing like actually eager move julie gould 13:50 ask bia could ask podcast guest series anything would ask bia dia 13:57 like lesson learn also like list like thing know back would love someone would tell people list hide somewhere please share like negative aspect positive aspect though julie gould 14:17 alright go ask guest share list thing wish would learn first get leslie rissler national science foundation leslie rissler 14:29 would tell younger self would say learn little bite teambuilding fundamental conflict management leadership thing benefit professionally personally lesson learn also list thing know would great someone tell need work hard love worry people disagree perseverance passion still important science help drive u brave kind people watch unbalance power dynamic reality harassment bias academia society inger mewburn 15:24 inger mewburn one piece advice give earlier self would say remember earn right ask favour research rely network concentrate network build database contact pay back year year network happen classroom conference meet people right brain actually handle robin goodwin say perhaps remember personal detail 120 people actually need sort database electronic use notion paper like bullet journal make note interaction people talk last common interest importantly concern need come across resource might paper contact person something put person touch resource remember thank generous always keep ledger others find whenever need help ask network provide might person directly help might friend create goodwill put price julie gould 16:47 next andrea armani university southern california u andrea armani 16:52 many thing would tell younger self important personal life set boundary early career set boundary make sure dinner every night husband give u chance talk day every friday date night really important health marriage important work advice make sure learn something new every day often take form go seminar department conference know go session outside specific field help network help know come research idea really help broaden personal research group think problem julie gould 17:55 finally last collection think bite advice cara tannenbaum university montreal cara tannenbaum 18:02 would tell younger self believe continue work hard love also play hard every chance get life short fun friend family along way might congratulate younger self persistence determination despite difficulty barrier would overcome persistence determination ultimately lead success would encourage younger self network explore opportunity outside comfort zone grow learn take new leadership opportunity always easy know task definitely surround support group likeminded individual work challenge whether career family presentation skill leadership skill surround good support network finally never give julie
