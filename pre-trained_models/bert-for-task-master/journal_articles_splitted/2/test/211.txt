lake flood occur water level lake exceed threshold cause inundation neighbour shoreline despite potential impact type flood neighbour settlement mechanism driver govern lake flood occur particularly result compound factor remain poorly understand compile analyze meteorological historical data lake flood lake como northern italy 1980 2020. identify seven mode lake flood climatebased driver 70 case

flood represent clear example potential compound mechanism govern exacerbate hazard traditionally extreme climatebased event study adopt univariate approach singular driver trigger singular hazard catastrophic event however fail represent simple assumption show widespread compoundness connectivity understand factor combine together order generate impact great importance reduce present future

water level lake threshold cause inundation neighbour settlement choice motivate intuition typology flood may good example compound event lack comprehensive literature lake flood flood usually classify three main typology i.e. fluvial pluvial coastal lake flood contrary le acknowledge despite importance lake human natural ecosystem severe impact associate example poyang lake largest freshwater lake china also one area frequently subject flood country extreme flood event need contemporaneous occurrence intense rainfall high lake inflow high water level yangtze river prevent water outflow lake summer 2020 lake flood event trigger repeat heavy rainfall cause direct economic loss 24 billion yuan affect 7 million people 185,000 ha crop cause indirect impact like increase risk transmission intestinal schistosomiasis lake champlain situate boundary canada usa subject recurrent flood generally flood result rapid snowmelt heavy rainfall late winter spring local increase severity due wind 2011 lake experience highest flood 100 year historic record last 67 day cause 82 million 2018 u damage contrast riverine flood lake flood characterize duration may also reach month higher persistence flood water increase damage material build infrastructure agriculture prevent crop reach maturity longer duration also likely deteriorate aquatic vegetation may enhance health issue like mould exposure lake flood impact may also aggravate several service lake provide community natural environment indepth analysis typology event also important context climate change likely increase lake level part globe like north america siberia tibetan plateau amazon basin addition shugar et al find global volume glacial lake increase 48 period 19902018. since trend may relate human natural factor better understand variable play role important understand predict trend water lake level compound perspective already apply study river flood multivariate compound flood i.e. due joint occurrence high river flow seiching storm surge model via copula several author statistical approach also adopt study spatially compound fluvial event example model joint flood occurrence confluence multiple river precondition compound event condition joint distribution antecedent moisture condition generate predecessor rain event bevacqua et al. instead define river level predictor via regression model include water input catchment previous 10 day account antecedent catchment wetness temporally compound event like exacerbation flood due multiple rainfall event close succession also consider literature case statistical model combine hydraulic model estimate flood hazard compound perspective may equally benefit study lake flood order lake level considerably increase inflow must higher capacity outlet stream balance e.g. due compound spring precipitation melt snow outflow must inadequate maintain equilibrium lake level e.g. period high discharge outlet stream hence several different factor combine contribute water level increase present study focus town como northern italy set bank homonymous lake lake como total drainage area 4543 km include basin upper adda river mera
