advent era big data promote development medicine data release important step exist medical data release method mostly use kanonymity model basis data protection advancement technology anonymous model progressively le resistant consistency attack background knowledge attack order better protect private information patient paper make two major contribution 1 method calculate correlation attribute use ensure validity data data release 2 basis previous step combine difference privacypreserving model tree model paper propose attribute associationbased differential privacy classification tree data publish method acdptree paper simulation experiment carry real medical data set experimental result show algorithm ensure validity availability data certain extent ensure patient 's privacy leak advent big data era bring lot convenience people 's life also change way medical data store traditional paper version medical information replace electronic medical record information therefore internet cloud platform blockchain widely use store various type medical information show fig 1 patient inform personal information doctor visit hospital doctor store patient 's personal information hospital 's database consultation form original dataset manage control hospital 's database manager data holder medical big data characteristic big data 5 v i.e. volume velocity variability value veracity addition medical data characterize structural polymorphism data information incompleteness temporality redundancy high sensitivity progress science technology improvement technology level medical diagnosis mean gradually advance order better help patient make diagnosis various advance medical equipment diagnosis mean apply process daily consultation form characteristic medical data modal diversity include textbased information patient personal consultation information doctor diagnosis result patient symptom description etc xray ct kind image medical image etc textbased information patient personal consultation information doctor diagnosis result patient symptom description picturebased information xray ct type medical image signal spectrumbased information ecg blood pressure graph videobased information ultrasound ultrasound surgery record data constantly update change time change patient vital sign medical data high timeliness continuity timeliness medical data reflect rescue infect patient corona virus disease addition medical big data also redundant patient visit hospital different disease system need reenter patient 's personal information time register thus generate large amount redundant personal information take lot time preprocess data waste lot storage space reduce availability data incompleteness medical big data usually reflect process data collection process consultation process patient 's description symptom unclear doctor 's subjective judgment incomplete diagnosis mean different relate factor cause incompleteness data consistency data achieve nowadays share medical information deeper medical research require data collector release collect relevant medical information medical big data carry large amount citizen personal information highly sensitive compare big data medical consultation information mainly contain sensitive information id card number social security number age disease suffer drug dosage attend doctor etc collect data release directly definitely cause leakage patient private information bring unnecessary trouble patient enough rely national law policy regulate medical institution necessary use scientific technological mean protect privacy patient medical information address issue researcher propose concept privacy protection model medical big data consist privacy protection algorithm privacy protection standard medical data process model release data analyze mine basis satisfy patient 's privacy disclose therefore protect patient privacy ensure data availability security release data major research hotspot present privacy preserve data distribution ppdp propose different response different application scenario traditional privacypreserving model mostly use anonymous model kanonymity ldiversity tcloseness anonymize data achieve privacy protection basic idea anonymous model achieve effect data indistinguishability thus privacy protection generalize data i.e. replace exact value fuzzy range example leng et al propose w k danonymity model take advantage dual semantics disease build semantic hierarchical tree achieve protection sensitive attribute restrict average
