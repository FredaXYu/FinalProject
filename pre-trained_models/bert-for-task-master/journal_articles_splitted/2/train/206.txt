effective measure improve road accessibility storm require traffic congestion cause storm flood increasingly constrain efficiency urban commute however flood impact urban road connectivity yet well assess due inaccurate simulation flood process urban area highresolution data drainage network gauge hydrological data insufficient thus study ass flood impact road network connectivity urban area southern china joint model 1d hydrodynamic process drainage network 2d flood inundation process road use mike urban mike 21. highresolution dem image 5 drainage network 5635 pipeline use urban hydrological simulation flood depth gauge model calibration validation recruit volunteer context citizen science result show road network connectivity decrease rainfall increase 40 road connectivity lose study area 1in100year return period rainfall occur study result help inform adaptive strategy local flood control study method also applicable improve urban hydrological model broader region flood cause increase damage loss human society era global climate change negative effect flood intense urban area intensive land use change past several decade urban flood considerably increase frequency severity due change urban hydrological process cause climate land use change flood control play critical role urban security management especially develop country experience rapid urbanization china flood significant impact various aspect human society understand complex nature flood loss provide foundation effective flood management generally two type loss flood direct indirect direct damage occur due physical contact flood water human property object indirect damage wideranging include interruption traffic may lead disruption enterprise production financial loss urban area indirect loss flood may widespread highrise build place refuge could reduce people 's direct contact floodwaters infrastructure lowlying area road water gas pipeline underground subway station well park lot flood also cause substantial indirect loss storm flood occur due heavy rainfall major type urban flood extreme rainfall combine acceleration runoff yield cause increase impervious surface urban area cause urban flood occur increasingly quickly urban infrastructure may flood short time example storminduced flood devastate zhengzhou city central region china july 2021 maximum 24h rainfall reach 663.9 mm water depth major flood road surpass 1 several hour cause flood damage 400,000 car 40.9 billion yuan loss moreover water depth subway tunnel exceed typical person 's chest height dozen minute directly claim life insufficient time escape lowlying traffic infrastructure become hotspot inundation loss due insufficient time people car evacuate rapid flood model develop improve urban flood management simulation urban hydrological process example bhattacharjee et al establish storm water management model analyze flood peak flow flood extent bhubaneswar city india use elevation slope land useland cover storm water drain infrastructure data jamali et al develop rufidam rapidly estimate flood extent depth associate damage rufidam test melbourne result prediction flood extent accumulate damage cost show acceptable accuracy addition simulation time reduce compare mike flood quan et al analyze impact land usecover change surface runoff evaluate flood risk shanghai simplify urban waterlogging model author find surface runoff depth increase 13.19 mm 1994 2006 due urbanization study contribute improve flood management urban area especially urban road network transportation infrastructure key component economic growth development urban area however infrastructure may comprise major asset affect inundation cause infrastructure damage also transportation disruption exist study ass vulnerability accessibility road flood jointly apply rainfallrunoff model 2d hydrodynamic model road network analysis example klipper et al evaluate accessibility road network hospital flood jakarta use urban hydraulic model katya et al analyze impact flood traffic st maarten netherlands integrate flood model mike flood traffic model sumo singh et al find 40 road length across indian road network become impassable 1in100year rainfall event occur via simulation road flood process road inundation map context various rainfall event generate use method study identify road flood risk however knowledge gap remain overall holistic assessment method evaluate performance inundation map lack cause difficulty compare different road inundation map various flood scenario integrate index one represent change road network connectivity across different flood scenario require inform urban flood management compare overall effect flood accordingly comprehensive method road flood analysis propose study jointly apply 2d flood model road inundation road network connectivity assessment dongguan city guangdong province china adopt case study area
