worldwide approximately 55.9 million people experience mtbi year importantly incidence rate mtbi typically derive hospitalisation rate give large proportion injury go unreported diagnose community

replicate remain unknown whether impairment extend cognitive domain highlight promise avenue present research current study investigate cognitive performance among individual selfreported history mtbi improve exist chronic mtbi research use series complex behavioural task rather traditional clinical measure examine broad range cognitive domain specifically measure visual work memory adopt change detection paradigm use arciniega et al. find negative impact mtbi extend previous research determine whether cognitive domain persistently impact mtbi also include task assess verbal work memory multitasking ability cognitive flexibility visuospatial ability response inhibition information process speed social cognition focus measure executive function e.g. work memory multitasking information process speed domain consistently investigate literature generally show impairment acute mtbi also include visuospatial social cognition task domain relatively underinvestigated chronic mtbi population measure postconcussion symptom depression anxiety also administer determine whether factor influence cognitive function addition experimental design propose analysis preregistered
