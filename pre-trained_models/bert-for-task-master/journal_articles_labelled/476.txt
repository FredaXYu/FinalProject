nirvana nothing beat teleportation vehiclefree instantaneous travel beammeupscotty technology get le attention transportation trope popular science run short explainers november 1993 september 2004 idea appeal regrettably decade much progress teleportation science report however since 2010s new discovery subatomic level shake play field specifically quantum teleportation month 2022 nobel prize physic award three scientist experiment entangle photon accord royal swedish academy science select winner recipient work demonstrate teleportation possible well least photon serious caveat could teleport physicist alain aspect john clauser anton zeilinger independent breakthrough last several decade result work demonstrate quantum entanglement action also show arcane property could channel teleport quantum information one photon another find anywhere close transform airport train station star trekstyle transporter make way promise application include quantum compute quantum network quantum encryption teleportation inspire word say maria spiropulu shangyi ch'en professor physic california institute technology director inqnet quantum network program evoke sens suggest weird phenomenon take place nothing weird take place quantum teleportation quantum mechanic hash early 20th century physicist like max planck albert einstein niels bohr erwin schr02dinger become clear subatomic particle level nature appear hide communication channel call quantum entanglement einstein describe phenomenon scientifically paper publish 1935 famously call spooky action distance appear defy normal rule physic time seem fantastical teleportation phrase first coin writer charles fort four year earlier describe unexplainable spectacle like ufo poltergeist fifty year ago scientist start quantum experiment say spiropulu still consider quite esoteric tribute scientist spiropulu print honor physicist richard feynman office feynman nobel prize 1965 feynman diagram graphical interpretation quantum mechanic spiropulu equate quantum entanglement share memory marry matter many divorce may explain make memory together connect forever subatomic level share memory particle enable instantaneous transfer information quantum state like atomic spin photon polarization distant particle bite information call quantum bite qubits classical digital bite binary mean hold value 1 0 qubits represent range 0 1 superposition mean certain probability 0 certain probability 1 time qubits ability take infinite number potential value simultaneously allow process information much faster physicist look system leverage quantum teleportation relate quantum teleportation real think qubits work information processor need share information way classical computer chip share information enter entanglement teleportation entangle subatomic particle like photon electron qubits separate operation perform one generate instantaneous response entangle twin farthest distance date qubits separate set chinese scientist use quantum entanglement send information tibet satellite orbit 870 mile away terra firma record ten mile travel fiber optic connection air line sight laser qubits strange behavior act like still together matter far apart separate continue puzzle amaze physicist appear magical spiropulu admit effect appear 'wow break engineer past five year great stride make quantum engineer apply mysterious predictable characteristic qubits besides quantum compute advance make tech giant like google ibm microsoft spiropulu spearhead government privately fund program build quantum internet leverage quantum teleportation guidance spiropulu 's postdoctoral researcher caltech venkata r. raju valivarthi neil sinclair stateoftheart quantum teleportation would work might want strap use laser stream photon shoot special optical crystal split photon pair pair photon entangle mean share information one change one two photon send fiber optic cable another medium capable transmit light air space distant location.this open quantum channel teleportation distant photon label photon one become receiver photon remain behind label photon two transmitter channel necessarily indicate direction information flow photon could distribute roundabout way third photon add mix encode information teleport third photon message carrier type information transmit could encode call photon 's property state position polarization momentum qubits come think encode message term 0 1 superposition one curious property quantum physic particle 's state property spin position know measure think like dice single die hold six value value know roll measure particle like roll dice lock specific value teleportation third photon encode joint measurement take second third photon property mean state measure time value lock like view value pair dice act measure change state second photon match state third photon soon second photon change first photon receive end quantum channel snap match state information lie photon one receiver however even though information teleport distant location still encode mean like unroll die indeterminate decode measure measurement photon one need match joint measurement take photon two three outcome joint measurement take photon two three record send photon one 's location repeat unlock information point photon two three go act measure photon destroy photon absorb whatever use measure like eye decode state photon one complete teleportation photon one must manipulate base outcome joint measurement also call rotate like roll dice way roll photon one two decode message similar binary 1 0 translate text numeric value teleportation may seem instantaneous surface decode instruction joint measurement send use light scenario fiber optic cable photon transfer information speed light important teleportation would otherwise violate einstein 's relativity principle state nothing travel faster speed light would lead sort bizarre implication possibly upend physic encode information photon three messenger teleport photon two 's position transmitter photon one 's position receiver decode whew quantum teleportation complete since transmit digital bite today use light might seem like quantum teleportation quantum network offer inherent advantage difference significant qubits convey much information bite plus quantum network secure since attempt interfere quantum entanglement would destroy open quantum channel researcher discover many different way entangle transmit measure subatomic information plus upgrade teleport information photon teleport information largersized particle like electron even atom relate warp speed space travel get tiny bite realistic still information transmit matter stuff human make ultimate dream may human teleportation actually might good thing yet star trek television film franchise help popularize teleportation also glamorize glittery dissolve effect catchy transportertone fly hand movie teleportation go wrong paint much darker possibly scientifically truer picture teleportation teleportation really act reincarnation teleportation live matter risky business would require scan traveler 's information point departure transmit information desire coordinate deconstruct point departure simultaneously reconstruct traveler point arrival would want errant copy loose would want arrive lifeless copy would arrive beat breathe blink system intact order process success teleport live be core matter life death formidable mind stephen hawk propose information vector state teleport quantum entanglement channel confine subatomic particle property fact entire blackholes worth trap information could teleport accord theory get weird entangle two blackholes connect wormhole spacetime shortcut information disappear one blackhole might emerge hologram reason vector state molecule human even entire planet could theoretically teleport hologram kip thorne caltech physicist 2017 nobel prize physic gravity wave detection may best explain possibility teleportation time travel far back 1988 one imagine advance civilization pull wormhole quantum foam enlarge classical size might analyze technique develop computation spontaneous wormhole production quantum tunnel spiropulu remain focus immediate promise quantum teleportation look anything like star trek 'beam scotty thing say yes lot progress \<SEP>4
