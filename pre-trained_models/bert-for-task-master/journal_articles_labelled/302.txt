cregan 's groundbreaking discovery stem cell human breast milk 2007. typically maternalderived cell human breast milk could divide two group bloodderived breastderived cell bloodderived cell mainly include immunological cell hematopoietic cell breastderived cell mainly comprise lactocytes myoepithelial cell report contain progenitor stem cell component breast milk cellular component could change dynamically within woman show total cell number colostrum significantly higher colostrum mature milk study well previous report compare cellular component leukocyte breast milk receive attention potential benefit protect infant infection accumulate evidence demonstrate breast milk leukocyte could increase breastfeed mother infant infection indicate tightly control process aim confer extra immunological support infant addition leukocyte hematopoietic stemprogenitor cell include cd34 cd117 cd133 also report present human breast milk however still debate percentage maternal bloodderived cell colostrum mature milk goudarzi et al report percentage cd34 cd117 cd133 significantly higher colostrum mature milk however li et al report percentage cd34 cell significantly higher transitional mature milk result consistent li et al. show percentage cd34 cd117 cd133 significantly higher mature milk colostrum might due race han chinese enrol li et al study date study breastderived cell breast

result different study include race ethnicity environment diet culture study show percentage cd90 cd105 cd146 cell significantly higher mature milk colostrum study still need determine characteristic role well mechanism transfer maternal blood breast milk well demonstrate maternal infant characteristic could affect human milk ingredient however little effort make identify influence factor cellular component breast milk study show maternal age negative influence cellular component colostrum include total cell number percentage cd45 ck5 cell result consistent previous report show higher maternal age might negative effect beneficial ingredient breast milk well performance offspring besides interest find maternal blood glucose positive influence percentage cd44 cell study keep hadarits et al report increase proportion hematopoietic stem progenitor cell population cord blood neonate bear mother gestational diabetes mellitus however study show gestational diabetes mellitus might affect differentiation potency hematopoietic stem cell umbilical cord blood moreover find maternal serum total protein level could partially reflect nutritional status mother significant positive influence cellular component mature milk therefore result indicate potential interaction maternal nutritional status implication longterm health offspring widely accept human breast milk contain numerous component provide benefit breastfeed infant explore physiological role health implication particular interest result show high percentage cd34 cell colostrum well high percentage cd133 cell low percentage cd105 cell mature milk associate significantly increase risk infantile eczema within first 3 month birth consistent result previous report show cd34 hemopoietic progenitor cell potent effector promote allergic inflammation might act proinflammatory effector cell directly contribute allergic inflammation past decade many active component human breast milk show associate development allergic disease include cytokine immunoglobulin growth factor human oligosaccharide polyunsaturated fatty acid polyamines among component show protective role allergic disease transform growth

inflammatory disease msc use therapeutic tool treatment atopic dermatitis innovative clinical trial msc prove mediate induction tolerance although mention much regenerative medicine manuscript main goal manuscript result provide useful clue attempt use msc therapy atopic dermatitis study still limitation first number participant study small might make statistical analysis limit skew second pair colostrum mature milk would better kind cohort study could better reflect change breast milk composition influence factor consequence third effort still need explore effect cellular component mature milk infantile eczema conclusion determine dynamic change cellular component especially stem cell human colostrum mature milk well influence factor potential clinical impact infant knowledge first
