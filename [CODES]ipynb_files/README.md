## Codes
########################################

### Notes: 

This folder contains the main code file which is a .ipynb format file with dense and long code to do the machine learning project; the files being used in this file; the data outputs from this file; the data-retrieving process from the EventRegistry API; and some trials using pre-trained models. 

The file named '[MAIN]Final_Project_Scientific_Articles.ipynb' is the main code file, which is very long and in detail. 

The file named 'Use_EventRegistry_API_to_retrieve_data_Jupyter.pdf' is a transformed version from its ipynb format, which is how I retrieve journal articles data using the API. 

The EXCEL format files are the data source which I use in my main code file. 

The 'Fastai_trial_Feb03.ipynb' file is just a trial where I have attempted to use the FastAI built by ULMFiT development team. 

The 'journal_articles' folder is the data output from my main code file, which contains cleansed data after data pre-processing, arranged by their subjects, and are in the same order as in the original data.

No one can use or copy any of my codes, especially if you are a University of London student, according to our university law. My models should not be practically used by any agency as a filter standard to weed any people, for example, in career interviews, or in filtering the journal articles. 

If you are a company or a research professional and want to use the conclusions or findings from my models, please contact me first: shireenyu2@163.com. You must give my works a proper citation, the format:
