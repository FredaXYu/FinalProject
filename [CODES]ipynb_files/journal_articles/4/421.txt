many quantum application require careful preparation quantum harmonic oscillator combination highpower microwave drive weak nonlinearity enable fast control system implication quantum compute metrology perfect quantum harmonic oscillator desire ingredient many modern quantum technology 'perfect mean without nonlinear interaction may lead loss distortion quantum state harmonic oscillator however many preparation procedure create squeeze state quantum sense specific qubit encode quantum information process need degree nonlinearity therefore contradiction arise make state faster loss rate system one require large nonlinear interaction may introduce new imperfection turn report nature physic alec eickbusch colleague demonstrate strong microwave drive enable universal control quantum harmonic oscillator nonlinearity much smaller loss rate
