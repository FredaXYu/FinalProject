quantum sense us electron spin diamond perform precise magnetic field measurement work well high magnetic field alternative approach involve spin carbon13 nucleus operate highfield regime desire scientist probe physical behaviour new regime drive continuous development highsensitivity sensor beyond single metric sensitivity practical sensor must meet additional requirement difficult satisfy simultaneously ability operate high static magnetic field wide temperature range write nature communication ozgur sahin coworkers demonstrate approach sense use carbon13 nuclear spin diamond provide highsensitivity spatial resolution magnetic field would degrade performance
