challenge face develop qmmm main challenge really figure approach system ask question thing understand well addition even big computer early 1960s late 1970s much le powerful small iphone today storage major problem code write way could run calculation despite limit storage another challenge eventually overcome quantum treatment accurate example try describe bond break quantum mechanically include effect protein bond would never break take time u realize point key understand best treat system always guide whether could reproduce reality saw could break bond enzyme system without include electrostatic effect environment major step forward qmmm later development focus calibrate quantum mechanic portion reproduce reality solution water protein calibrate quantum region would transfer protein without change version qmmm call empirical valence bond evb look regard like highschool chemistry simple fact many approach look simple lead lot criticism rejection research community challenge example typical criticism use since quantum mechanic could reproduce energy h molecule obviously enzyme could model correctly either however reason approach work larger molecule enzyme try use quantum mechanic exact energy calculation instead simple quantum part force reproduce experimental reality water consistent way move quantum part protein captivate public relatively fast simple idea separate qm mm rather way make accurate large degree pushback first mid1990s people use approach le
