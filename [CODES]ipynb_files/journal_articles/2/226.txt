exquisite dinosaur mummy call dakota show evidence feast ancient predator around 67 million year ago north dakota duckbilled dinosaur keel die crocodile ancient relative descend carcass tear hole skin mark bone today evidence predator feast still see dino 's fossilize remain include remarkable mummify skin linger bite mark may help explain dinosaur become mummy first place new study suggest research publish wednesday oct. 12 journal plo one open new tab also propose dinosaur mummy exceptionally wellpreserved skin soft tissue may common scientist think use assumption order get mummy absolutely rapid burial mean dinosaur would bury almost instantaneously near time death say stephanie drumheller colead author study palaeontologist university tennessee knoxville dinosaur 's body cover sediment perhaps sudden landslide flash flood remain would shield element teeth hungry scavenger give animal 's skin chance mummify unintuitively predator partially eat remain actually help longterm stabilization thing like skin long enough get bury underground secondary chemical change happen drumheller tell live science seem reasonable say brian pickle associate professor ecology university read unite kingdom involve study carcass scavenge sandbar riverbank nothing particularly edible leave behind plausible skin bone could leave quite skin dry sun cover pickle tell live science email drumheller colleague draw conclusion examine wellknown edmontosaurus fossil house north dakota heritage center state museum bismarck specimen nickname dakota discover 1999 ranch near marmarth southwestern north dakota specifically excavate hell creek formation fossilpacked geological formation take shape near end cretaceous period 145 million 66 million year ago start paleogene period 66 million 23 million year ago edmontosaurus fossil miss head tip tail may also miss leave forelimb rest animal 's bone intact colead author clint boyd senior paleontologist north dakota geological survey tell live science large swath preserve skin cover bone dinosaur 's right forelimb hind limb tail skin deep brown almost brownish black actually bite shine much iron fossilization process say mindy householder study coauthor fossil preparator state historical society north dakota bismarck almost look like glitter say dakota 's glitter skin go public display heritage center start 2014 although time fossil completely free rock surround 2018 fossil preparators set clean specimen thoroughly process uncover mark look suspiciously like bite mark initially study coauthor becky barnes paleontologist lab manager north dakota geological survey flag potential bite mark specimen 's tail householder find pinky finger right forelimb bite mark leave bone fossilize quite clearly team start search mark earnest find distinct imprint crocodilian teeth dakota 's bone however find bite mark skin trickier drumheller say skin stretch tear bite decomposition process warp tissue get sense bite mark dinosaur skin might look like team look forensic study modern mammal human body though dinosaur skin thicker durable human skin perfect comparison drumheller note analysis researcher discern deep rake furrow puncture dakota 's tail likely make teeth claw drag flesh possible crocodilian dinosaur large deinonychosaur juvenile tyrannosaurus rex may leave mark study author suggest team also find dozen puncture wind dakota 's right hand forelimb note skin latter partially peel back likely predator feed injury suggest dakota 's carcass remain unburied vulnerable scavenge time dinosaur 's death dino rapidly bury mummify researcher turn forensic literature answer learn mode decomposition might apply dakota many mummify dinosaur mummification process study author call desiccation deflation dinosaur carcass could remain unburied week even month animal insect microbe tear hole skin eat away animal 's internal organ gap hole skin would enable gas fluid associate decomposition seep dinosaur thus help skin thoroughly dry desiccate point carcass would don deflate appearance skin associate dermal structure drape closely underlie bone accord study deflate dino would bury fully fossilize later date would end look like mummify dakota specimen appear today something actually fairly predictable forensic literature drumheller say something look context dinosaur mummy previously dinosaur mummy form desiccation deflation author stress reasonable think dino mummy likely form rapid burial previously think alternatively may form submerge deep water little oxygen present team write study lack oxygen deep water would slow decomposition process enable mummification unfold process document socalled bog body swamppreserved remain medieval human point researcher feel confident know happen dakota dinosaur 's death burial detail unfold burial remain fuzzy team plan study chemical reaction enable dinosaur skin fossilize context hop analyze dinosaur mummy likely form way dakota also linger question much fossilize dinosaur skin discover belong duckbilled dinosaur pickle say predator scavenger leave skin behind highly abundant herbivore would expect find lot ceratopsian sauropod fossil skin say another question explore followup study meanwhile research get grind dinosaur enthusiast currently visit dakota 's right forelimb leave foot tail north dakota heritage center state museum boyd say rest specimen still clean examine fossil preparators spend 14,000 hour work dakota far expect spend several thousand hour remarkable mummy work do copyright 2022
