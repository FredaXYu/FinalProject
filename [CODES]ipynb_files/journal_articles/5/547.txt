large body research show urbanization high population density important impact ecological environment include climate carbon emission water land resource scholar predict urban growth century generate

plateau city city outside region pattern characterize sparsely populate area consistent trend modern urbanization consequently overall function area far greater individual city within hence study urban system include main city town associate overall urban function plateau objective study find sustainable urban system qinghaitibet plateau explore urbanization model sparsely populate area term sustainable urban system since sustainable city define city achievement social economic physical development make last last supply natural resource development depend sustainable urban system refer
