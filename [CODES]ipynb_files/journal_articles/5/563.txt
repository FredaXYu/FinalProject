mucormycosis invasive fungal infection immunocompromised patient high mortality despite early diagnosis timely therapeutic intervention two last decade study show increase mucormycosis compare invasive mycoses aspergillosis among people withimmune deficiency best knowledge research one largest study provide comparison epidemiology clinical aspect mucormycosis child adult develop country iran although mucormycosis worldwide occurrence frequency variable different world regions.the exact incidence mucormycosis clear partly populationbased studiesthat differ capture period population definition diagnostic procedure accord previous study kontoyiannis et al. conduct unite state incidence mucormycosisrelated hospitalization estimate 0.12 per 10,000 discharge january 2005 june 2014. however recent study declare 80 time higher prevalence mucormycosis india develop country result study annual incidence mucormycosis 1.76 per 10,000 hospitalize case little report hedayati et al iran 2018.our result support data previously report vaezi et al present far province shiraz second province iran term high prevalence mucormycosis regard demographic characteristic patient suffer mucormycosis show occurrence disease wide spectrum age childhood old age accord previous report mucormycosis rare infection child hence case study literature current study child consist approximately onefourth 23.2 total populationwith mucormycosis previous study agreement investigation vaezi et al average age case study almost 40 year report mean age vary 50 60 year study iran male predominance note study similar previous study however sex difference significant among child author correlate tendency protective effect estrogen correlation may valid child younger 12 year old prevalence mucormycosis study higher autumn accordance investigation declare previously environmental factor temperature humidity affect mold distribution air result seasonal variation exposure spore base study different part iran country world diabetes mellitus enumerate common underlie condition mucormycosis accordance previous investigation current study show diabetes mellitus relevant predispose factor

country recent year lead low level consumption study possible compare efficacy posaconazole management mucormycosis adult child moreover isavuconazole another therapeutic agent available country 's pharmaceutical market accord result inhospital mortality rate 14.6. however overall mortality rate mucormycosis report range 21.4 46.7 previous study low inhospital mortality rate report earlier study low mortality rate compare study may due several reason 1 report mortality rate study base inhospital mortality exclude mortality data follow discharge previously declare multani collegeues 1year mortality rate increase significantly compare inhospital mortality.therefore patient could follow longer period time mortality rate might increase 2 lower mortality rate observe cutaneous infection therefore variable mortality rate report different study may relate site infection 3 underlie condition play crucial role mortality rate mucormycosis previously state immunocompetent status absence trauma relate highest survival rate therefore low mortality rate observe study might result small number hsct patient cns mucormycosis among research population 4 addition possible case mucormycosis lead death might properly diagnose study child mortality rate zero addition mention prematurity neonate age le 1 year development disseminate form mucormycosis also declare risk factor mortality several study conduct population 09 18 year investigation case premature neonate disseminate mucormycosis find child 's group besides lack report inhospital mortality among child may link high proportion immunocompetent condition study population various major limitation must acknowledge study current study mortality information confine hospital lenght stay moreover diagnosis mucormycosis perform base clinical feature histological examination result specific culture method specie identification antifungal susceptibility test isolate hence available data specie distribution resistance pattern causative agent another limitation unavailability drug formulation country isavuconazole make practically impossible evaluate efficacy ofthis treatment although exploration need evaluate efficacy new therapeutic agent fungal infection could claim amphotericin b effective antifungal management mucormycosis far hope increase awareness fungal infection culture clinical specimen antifungal susceptibility test molecularbased method give attention particular subject diagnosis management fungal infection far know current study first survey point epidemiological aspect clinical presentation therapeutic intervention outcome mucormycosis comparison adult child southwest iran 8 year 20132021. change epidemiology mucormycosis occur recent year due increase atrisk population especially develop country study diabetes mellitus hematological malignancy find predispose condition also rhinoorbitocerebral clinical type frequent form patient early diagnosis prompt clinical intervention may result increase survival
