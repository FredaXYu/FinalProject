<b>Any codes in this folder should not be used in any individual's project</b>, especially if you are a University of London student. This is based on the university law.    

If you really want to use my codes, you should write an email to me to gain my consent. My email is shireenyu@163.com.

My models should not be practically used by any agency as a filter standard to weed any people, for example, in career interviews, or in filtering the journal articles. 

If you are a company and want to use my models, please contact me first. 

The results of my models should be referenced in your paper, if you use my conclusions. The citation format:
