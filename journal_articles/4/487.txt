pair merge black hole show extreme sign gravityinduced orbital precession wobble predict albert einstein 's theory general relativity pair black hole see wobble rate three time per second merge extreme example prediction make albert einstein 's general theory relativity see clearly first time wobble know precession occur orbit rotation object slowly change time common example spin top begin spin different angle slow gravityinduced orbital precession consequence general relativity 's prediction heavy object bend spacetime see shape object 's orbit change time effect observe weakly neutron star orbit one another subtle orbit wobble precess rate time year mark hannam cardiff university uk colleague see much extreme effect pair black hole cause one spin fifth speed light 90degree angle orbital motion merge black hole release gravitational wave know gw200129 carry signature precession rate three time second 10 billion time faster find earlier measurement really extreme regime einstein 's theory space time warp distort completely crazy way say hannam identify precession team reanalysed data first collect 2020 three gravitational wave detector base u italy japan previous analysis reveal precession use advance model account source noise data hannam team find best way explain signal one black hole spin almost upper limit allow general relativity cause orbit system precess astrophysical implication detection quite significant say fabio antonini cardiff university involve work extreme spin misalignment orbit predict current idea black hole formation involve implode star need another explanation
