university miami provide fund member conversation u hurricane ian intensify way toward florida coast hurricane hunter sky something almost unimaginable fly center storm pas scientist aboard plane take measurement satellite send forecaster national hurricane center jason dunion university miami meteorologist lead national oceanic atmospheric administration 's 2022 hurricane field program describe technology team use gauge hurricane behavior real time experience aboard p3 orion plunge eyewall hurricane happen aboard hurricane hunter fly storm basically take fly laboratory heart hurricane way category 5 fly crunch data send forecaster climate modeler p3s routinely cut middle storm right eye picture x pattern keep cut storm multiple time mission might develop storm might category 5 typically fly altitude around 10,000 foot quarter way ocean surface top storm want cut roughest part storm try measure strongest wind hurricane center intense describe scientist experience flight intense flight dorian 2019. storm near bahamas rapidly intensify strong category 5 storm wind around 185 mph felt like feather wind come eyewall dorian seat belt lose hundred foot couple second draft hit updraft gain hundred foot matter second lot like rollercoaster ride know exactly next come one point gforces 3 4 g astronaut experience rocket launch also get zero g second anything strap float even rough part storm scientist like busy computer work data technician back may launch dropsonde belly plane check quality data send model center national hurricane center learn hurricane flight one goal better understand storm rapidly intensify rapid intensification storm increase speed 35 mph day equate go category 1 major category 3 storm short period time ida 2021 dorian 2019 michael 2018 recent hurricane rapidly intensify happen near land catch people unprepared get dangerous fast since rapid intensification happen really short time span hurricane hunter take measurement storm come together far rapid intensification hard predict might start see ingredient quickly come together ocean warm great depth atmosphere nice juicy lot moisture around storm wind favorable also look inner core structure storm look like start consolidate satellite offer forecaster basic view need get hurricane hunter storm really pick hurricane apart storm look like rapidly intensify hurricane like stand straight think spin top one thing look alignment storm yet fully together might lowlevel circulation kilometer ocean line midlevel circulation 6 7 kilometer healthy storm hour later might fly back storm notice two center line sign could rapidly intensify also look boundary layer area ocean hurricane breathe draw air low level air rush eyewall vent top storm away center get huge updraft eyewall might watch dropsonde tail doppler radar data wind flow boundary layer really moist air rush toward center storm boundary layer deep storm also take bigger inhale also look structure lot time storm look healthy satellite get radar structure sloppy eye may fill cloud tell u storm quite ready rapidly intensify flight might start see structure change pretty quickly air breathe great way diagnose storm breathe look healthy good sign intensify storm instrument use measure forecast hurricane behavior need instrument measure atmosphere also ocean wind steer storm tear apart ocean heat moisture fuel use dropsondes measure temperature humidity pressure wind speed send back data every 15 foot way ocean surface data go national hurricane center model center get better representation atmosphere one p3 laser crl compact rotational raman lidar measure temperature humidity aerosol aircraft way ocean surface give u sense juicy atmosphere conducive feed storm crl operate continuously entire flight track get beautiful curtain aircraft show temperature humidity plane also tail doppler radar measure moisture droplet air blow determine wind behave give u 3d look wind field like xray storm get satellite also launch ocean probe call axbts aircraft expendable bathythermograph ahead storm probe measure water temperature several hundred foot typically surface temperature 26.5 degree celsius 80 fahrenheit favorable hurricane depth heat also important warm ocean water maybe 85 f surface 50 foot water quite bite colder hurricane go mix cold water pretty quickly weaken storm deep warm water like find eddy gulf mexico provide extra energy fuel storm year also test new technology small drone launch belly p3 7 9foot wingspan basically weather station wing one drone drop eye could measure pressure change indicate whether storm get stronger could drop drone eyewall orbit could measure strongest wind another important detail forecaster also lot measurement boundary layer safe place plane fly also target cabo verde island africa first time year look cabo verde island atlantic 's hurricane nursery seedling hurricane come africa try determine tip point thesis disturbance form storm half name storm get atlantic come nursery include 80 major hurricane important even though disturbance maybe seven 10 day ahead hurricane form africa lot thunderstorm develop along sahara desert 's southern border cooler moister sahel region summer temperature difference cause ripple develop atmosphere call tropical wave tropical wave precursor hurricane however saharan air layer huge dust storm come roll africa every three five day suppress hurricane storm peak june midaugust tropical disturbance better chance reach caribbean point far future national hurricane center sevenday forecast rather five day figure improve early
