extend nonmodel organism indeed last fifteen year use snp population genetics develop extensively use genomic tool ass pattern genetic variation population advantage snp include higher number analyze locus thousand hundred thousand result extensive screen genome lower genotyping error higher reproducibility among laboratory precise estimate diversity due high mutation rate microsatellites may lead underestimate heterozygosity however challenge use snp still remain requirement large number marker obtain robust estimation genetic variation among population compare multiallelic microsatellites advantage snp provide higher level polymorphism faster evolutionary rate low level ascertainment bias consequently although use snp become increasingly popular microsatellites disregard fact kind marker may consider complementary evolutionary biology may respond different issue example adaptive process assess use neutral marker microsatellites locate noncoding region snp locate cod noncoding
