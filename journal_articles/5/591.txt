influence nssi behavior adolescent factor could use directly intervene adolescent nssi behavior timely treatment adolescent negative emotional state directly conducive prevent nssi behavior alleviate severity psychological behavioral problem adolescent especially certain behavior link health risk currently attract considerable attention selfinjury adolescent major public health problem global data show adolescent nonsuicidal selfinjury nssi behavior endanger physical mental health adolescent also lead adolescent suicide study show people nssi behavior high risk suicide suicide mortality rate 42

extremely serious prevalence 5.457.4. many factor affect adolescent nssi behavior include biology cognition emotion negative life event stress first endogenous opioid peptide hormone affect individual perception pain affect emotional regulation emotional disorder may bring nssi behavior also believe borderline personality disorder relate behavioral affective disorder may important factor affect nssi behavior level physical exercise undertake may affect hormonal balance individual subsequently affect emotional state explore relationship role physical exercise regulate emotional status nssi behavior second selfefficacy may impact individual emotion regulation positive negative function selfefficacy expand study impact individual nssi behavior furthermore stress condition stress regulation outcome may affect individual nssi behavior finally peer family school social support system positive effect regulation adolescent stress sleep quality also relate individual stress although previous scholar discuss reason nssi behavior explain intervene nssi behavior use multidimensional influence factor chinese adolescent experience pressure study interpersonal relationship
