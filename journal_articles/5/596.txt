korean japanese participant vary degree ethnocentrism although chinese pakistani culture collectivistic many dissimilarity example share cultural attribute individual nation tendency toward

thus different level ethnocentrism among participant country consequently affect intercultural willingness communicate despite collectivistic culture pakistan china share many dissimilarity range medium system political system cultural norm dissimilarity among people term willingness communicate different culture due disparate norm value communication practice therefore hypothesize follow

two communication predisposition ethnocentrism intercultural willingness communicate influence individual intent toward intercultural interaction people different cultural background thus ethnocentrism lead lack intercultural willingness communicate result cultural conflict context knowledge communication predisposition ethnocentrism help identify factor responsible create cultural conflict two culture consequently also facilitate adopt effective communication strategy address conflict individual two different culture although ethnocentrism individual disposition vary culture culture primarily contextual cultural regard ethnocentrism negative positive characteristic furthermore literature suggest member collective culture follow ingroup authority eager uphold veracity ingroup reluctant collaborate people outgroups therefore people culture expect ethnocentric le willingness communicate moreover ethnocentric people tend foster supportive relationship people belong ingroup contentious toward possibly reluctant cooperate outgroup member ibid therefore ethnocentrism largely consider adverse trait associate intercultural communication scenario ethnocentrism stem ambiguity diminish intercultural willingness communicate instance individual perceive higher extent ambiguity communicate outgroup member e.g. stranger member ingroup therefore ethnocentrismdriven intercultural communicative anxiety prevent individual communicate effectively promote put 'patriotism one 's group interest act communication barrier people different culture background hence ethnocentrism affect people 's attitude toward one another addition communication behavior interact one another intercultural set light literature therefore propose third hypothesis negative influence ethnocentrism predisposition toward intercultural willingness communicate pakistani chinese student past research identify regardless cultural dissimilarity among culture demographic attribute vital predict several predisposition behavioral outcome demographic attribute sociocultural factor norm belief provide ecological environment individual give culture turn individual learn groom within ecological environment example people learn acceptable behavior i.e. norm regulate social institution available ecological set hand demographic also expose people diverse ecological set allow learn differently even within culture hence demographic segment menwomen particular culture different socialization base ecological resource provide member example pakistani woman guide family system ecological resource concern interactcommunicate encounter men possible demographic attribute ecological set among diverse nation enable different viewpoint different action accordingly action attitude ethnocentrism intercultural willingness communicate certainly influence demographic attribute thus demographic variable gender past interaction foreigner background urban rural influence attitude respondent instance recent study report gender significantly influence ethnocentrism intercultural willingness respondent intercultural set likewise respondent 's background also play significant role ethnocentric score consequently intercultural willingness communicate addition experience interaction foreigner another variable affect ethnocentrism intercultural willingness communicate socioeconomic status gender respondent influence academic performance therefore context study assume gender past experience interaction foreigner rural urban background respondent influence ethnocentrism intercultural willingness communicate thus hypothesize follow base demographic feature gender foreign interaction urban rural background difference influence ethnocentrism predisposition
