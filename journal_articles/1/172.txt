water scarcity lack sufficient water certain part world plague twentyfirst century water scarcity across globe threat human health environment food supply socioeconomic development around 1.2 billion people access safe drink water global south additional 700 million people expect displace world due water scarcity international water management institute predict severe water scarcity 2025 multiple country global south due increase population growth manmade pollution also approximately 4 billion people worldwide predict affect water scarcity 2050 severity impact water scarcity may worse currently observe due exponential growth human population indeed enter anthropocene epoch start 1800s manmade activity begin significantly impact planet 's climate ecosystem environmental resource epoch impact human pressure environment outrun natural environmental process shape environment past geological time one key feature anthropocene unprecedented increase use fossil fuel lead massive frequent air pollution put human health risk jeopardize earth system 's ability provide clean drink water human accord rosenfeld anthropogenic air pollution may aggravate water scarcity issue suppress rainfall process example early study report reduction rainfall jiului valley romania follow period poor air quality drive particulate matter generate thermoelectric power plant coal mine field record rainfall suppression haifa bay region israel attribute air pollution since rainfall delay notably pronounce period massive urbanization heavy industrial activity region haifa bay harbour major pollution source consist coalfired power plant refinery several industrial activity dense population furthermore jirak cotton investigate effect air pollution rainfall along front range colorado rocky mountain unite state reach similar conclusion similarly australia urban industrial air pollution report completely suppress precipitation 2.5km deep cloud whilst heavy smoke forest fire suppress rainfall 5kmdeep tropical cloud mechanism propose explain suppression rainfall air pollutant aerosol serve small cloud condensation nucleus ccn form large concentration small cloud droplet turn prevent collision coalescence droplet without rainfallforming process disrupt however hypothesis rainfall suppression air pollution hold would expect cloud seed pollute environment would accelerate conversion cloud water precipitation thus enhance rainfall amount unfortunately pollute area generally drier rain enhancement cloud seed remain inconclusive geography even study commission world meteorological organization international union geodesy geophysics hypothesis clear conclusion difficult establish clear causal relationship aerosol precipitation determine sign precipitation change climatological sense base many observation model simulation effect aerosol cloud clearly understand particularly icefree cloud effect precipitation le clear therefore hypothesis rainfall suppression need investigation present study aim contribute further knowledge front particularly waterstressed world e.g. south africa south africa indeed one waterstressed country list amongst prominent southern african region predict undergo severe water scarcity 2025. annual average rainfall south africa 465 mm approximately half global annual average rainfall 860 mm vaal triangle region south africa environmental concern due alarm record air pollutant concentration couple increase population growth urbanization comparable example haifa bay israel jiulu valley romania elevate air pollution concentration vaal triangle drive manmade activity industrial process power generation mine fossil fuel burn biomass burn transportation waste incineration domestic fuel burn water treatment work agricultural practice present study aim test hypothesis air pollutant prevent reduce rainfall use vaal triangle south africa model system do use firstly full year data secondly rainy season data 21 year south africa rely heavily dirty energy source e.g. coalpower plant drive economic growth result several air pollution hotspot country cause various public health
