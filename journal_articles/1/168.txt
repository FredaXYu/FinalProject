conventionally name normal ovarian responder group vary result study base patient different ethnicity include asian western country however best knowledge study evaluate korean patient accord poseidon

role age decide patient 's art prognosis however several chinese study report somewhat different result state higher pregnancy rate lbrs group 1 3 compare group 2 4. particularly abdullah et al observe patient por younger age low prognosis poseidon 3 show acceptable probability live birth better perinatal outcome compare older counterpart poseidon 2 emphasize influence age art prognosis increase chance conception multiple art cycle prove evidence moreover accord mathematicallyvalidated model predict live birth rate embryo transfer develop awadalla et al. age embryo morphology take
