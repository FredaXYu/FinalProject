100 year researcher attempt grow mammalian embryo laboratory study mysterious force factor transform fertilize egg mature organism two group one write nature cell use advance cellculture technique stemcell biology progress towards goal group grow structure resemble mouse embryo vitro without need sperm egg uterus 'embryoids develop stage equivalent mouse midgestation mark impressive advance ability study early mammalian development first step embryonic development vivo fertilize egg undergo multiple cell division selforganizes hollow ball cell call blastocyst subsequently implant uterine wall blastocyst contain three cell type epiblast give rise embryo along support trophectoderm primitive endoderm fig 1a mouse embryonic stem cell mescs isolate blastocyst maintain culture coax generate specific cell lineage however mescs generate complete embryo vitro generate culture three blastocyst cell type together could theoretically enable embryonic development current study amadei et al tarazi et al set use 'assembloidlike approach group culture mescs along mesc line transiently overexpressed gata4 transcription factor specific primitive endoderm supply trophectoderm amadei colleague add cell line similar trophectoderm whereas tarazi colleague use mescs transiently overexpressed trophectodermspecific transcription factor cdx2 remarkably three day mix cell organize embryonic structure call egg cylinder fig 1b continue culture optimize culture medium together use rotate chamber know dynamic culture enable embryoids develop ever achieve structure resemble mouse embryo develop 8.5 day stage dub e8.5 group use singlecell rna sequence detail cellular atlas benchmark embryoid development demonstrate growth stop initial outset organ differentiation analysis tissue cell marker reveal develop tissue embryoids organize similar manner vivo counterpart example mouse embryoids contain structure resemble primitive gut beat heart bilateral pair somite would give rise rib skeletal muscle group also identify structure resemble precursor forebrain midbrain spinal cord although neural development yet begin group perform experiment demonstrate potential model system instance amadei et al generate mouse embryoids stem cell pax6 gene involve brain eye development delete embryoids show similar defect pax6deficient embryo grow vivo demonstrate embryoids could use study genetrait relationship tarazi et al grow embryoids stemcell line primordial germ cell become sperm egg fluoresce identify time location genesis development mouse embryoids major advance previous effort model postimplantation development ex vivo mouse embryoids could future use study environmental factor genetic abnormality contribute pregnancy failure furthermore compare embryoids vivo embryo reveal aspect development rely maternal influence placenta extrinsic developmental cue several limitation could prevent use embryoids immediate research therapeutic question however failure rate high group estimate le 1 start cell cluster successfully develop embryoids tarazi et al show mesc line produce embryoids could develop six day culture indicate embryoid development depend state start cell furthermore embryoids highly variable size shape importantly lack development past e8.5 note group prevent investigation development organ neural tissue optimization three start cell population culture condition key overcome limitation instance embryoid culture medium contain serum blood rat human umbilical cord serum poorly characterize vary batch might major effect embryoid development change carbon dioxide oxygen mix control pressurize medium tweak dynamic culture condition might allow longer vitro growth factor hypothesize enable proper development incorporation component stemcellderived placental cell type could extend embryoid development reduce variability worth highlight actual mouse embryo stemcellderived model early mouse embryonic development use term 'synthetic embryo cellbased model development generally discourage international society stem cell research isscr consensus around unify nomenclature need accurately represent embryoidbased approach scientist public currently do cellbased model development eventually researcher want apply find human stem cell larger size human embryo might mean embryo depend heavily mouse embryo placenta vascular system property could inherently limit vitro development depend diffusion nutrient gas exchange human development take several time long reach stage equivalent e8.5 generate human embryoids late stage costly le feasible use human cell pose unique ethical challenge isscr update guideline balance ethical concern need research example '14day rule limit vitro study human embryo first two week development replace oversight guideline specific consent human stem cell use embryoid research legal issue need revisit humanembryoid experiment proceed current study elevate mouse stemcell biology
